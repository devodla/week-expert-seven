### FAQ

- browser-sync is throwing errors in Windows and never starts:
  - Solution: Replace browser-sync with http-server.
    1. install the **http-server** with `npm i -D http-server`.
    2. in package.json delete the whole `browser-sync` command and replace it with `npx http-server .`
    3. now the project will be running on :8080 so go in the browser and try to access http://localhost:8080/
       The only thing is, the project won't restart when you change some code, you'll need to hit F5 every time you change something
